# Upgrading

If you already have the Mod DJI Fly app installed, and you wish to update to a newer version, then just follow the same installation instructions that you were sent originally, but ignore the step about uninstalling your current app.

Unless you are told otherwise you will be uble to update direct to the latest version without uninstalling.
