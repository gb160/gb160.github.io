# Unsigned Installation

**Remember this ipa is not signed, if your iDevice is not jailbroken YOU have to sign the app before you can install it.**

# To install on a non-jailbroken device

* Download the ipa from: [Dropbox link](http://moddjifly.ddns.net)
* Then sign and install manually.

# To install on a jailbroken device

* Make sure you have installed the package 'appsync unified' from Cydia.
* Then on the iDevice go to: [Apppbox link](http://flyunsigned.ddns.net)
* Tap on 'Install application', then tap 'install' when the alert pops up...return 	to your home screen to see installation progress.

(Alternatively you can download the ipa from: [Dropbox link](http://moddjifly.ddns.net) and then install it manually)


# When the app is installed

You will need internet access on the device for the initial activation.

* When the app is installed, on the iDevice go to iOS Settings app -> Mod DJI Fly
* Then enter your login details in the login field.
* Then open the Mod DJI Fly app (if you've already opened the app after installation, force close it, then re-open it)
* agree to the normal prompts exactly how you would on the stock app. 
**The only very important prompt is to allow location services**

Once you get to the DJI Fly home screen, go back to the iOS settings and verify that in the status field it now says 'Activated'.

That's it, you're good to go... there will be no prompts when you launch the app, as long as your status says 'Activated' you will be in FCC mode. Of course this can still be verified in the transmission tab of the app.

It goes without saying don't share/post your login information anywhere, there is absolutely no reason to do so.
If you have more than one device registered with us (some people have multiple devices or registered devices for friends) you will have 2/3/4 different logins, make sure you only use one login on each device, and please inform any other users (friends etc) of their login information.

**Sharing logins will result in your account being banned**

Any issues/questions then just let me know/ask


# Upgrading

If you already have the Mod DJI Fly app installed, and you wish to update to a newer version, then just follow the same installation instructions that you were sent originally, but ignore the step about uninstalling your current app.

Unless you are told otherwise you will be able to update direct to the latest version without uninstalling.
