# Information


Please read the following before doing anything:

This app is iOS only, current version is v1.2.5

**YOU MUST ARRANGE APP SIGNING YOURSELF**

**PLEASE ASK ABOUT THIS BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER IF YOU'RE NOT SURE.**

**By purchasing the app it is presumed that you know how to sign the app and install on your device.**


If you have a jailbroken iDevice you wont need to sign the app.

We can guarantee that the current app version will achieve FCC mode with the current firmware, we don't know what the future holds so update the firmware at your own risk.

Due to limited test devices, we can only guarantee the app will work on iOS12, iOS13 and iOS14 ...we hold no responsibility if you're running an older or beta OS and the app doesn't work.

**You will be issued a login that will activate the app on 1 device for 12 months, any attempt to use one login on multiple devices will result in the account being suspended.**

You will be entitled to free updates within that 12 months.

If none of this is a problem then tap the icon below to Paypal £15 UK/GBR (RECIPIENT RECEIVES, AS FRIENDS AND FAMILY)

Do not select 'Paying for goods or services' or a handling fee to paypal will be charged.

Please put your email address in the PayPal reference so I know who you are, and send me a quick email confirming your payment has been made, PayPal notifications 
are very often late/non existent.

**Note: If you email me and get no response, please check your spam/junk folder. I respond to every email.**
**Also please note that many Russian email domains block emails from ProtonMail (because they're encrypted), so if your email address end with '.ru' please use a different one. Hotmail/Live/Gmail all work fine.**
