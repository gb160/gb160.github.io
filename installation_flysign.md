## Flysign Guide
* **This guide can only be used when you have your '.mobileprovision' and '.p12' files, and your .p12 password... these will all be provided by UDID Registrations or can be retrieved from your apple developer account. If using UDID registrations the p12 password is nearly always '123456'**

* This method is the quickest and easiest way to install the app without a jailbreak, as the signing and installation can be done direct from your iDevice without downloading the .ipa file meaning a Mac/PC isn't required... just transfer/email your .p12 and .mobileprovision files to your iDevice.

* New: When you have your device registered with UDID registrations you can now sign/install Mod DJI Fly with just your UDID 
* Go to: [FlySign](https://flysign.ddns.net)
* Click/tap on 'UDID'
* Enter your .p12 password (or leave blank for 123456)
* Click/tap on the 'sign app' button

Or if you have your own .p12/.mobileprovision files...

* Go to: [FlySign](https://flysign.ddns.net)
* Click/tap on 'signing'
* Select your '.mobileprovision' and '.p12' files.
* Enter your .p12 password
* Click/tap on the 'sign app' button


Then:
* After a few seconds a QR Code will appear on the screen
* * If you are on a PC/Mac, just open the camera on your iDevice and let it focus on the QR Code, then select 'open in iTunes' and agree to the install prompt.
* * If you are using your iDevice tap and hold the QR Code, then select 'open in iTunes' and agree to the install prompt.
* The app will now install to your homescreen, installation can take a few minutes so be patient.
