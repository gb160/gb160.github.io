# Upgrading

**If upgrading from v1.2.x you do not need to uninstall the Mod DJI Fly app first, just follow the installation instructions below, you wont have to login/authenticate again if you do it this way...you only need to uninstall if you were using an old version or a Mod app from another provider**


# Unsigned Installation

**Remember this ipa is not signed, if your iDevice is not jailbroken YOU have to sign the app before you can install it.**

**The unsigned ipa for v1.2.1 is still being tested (although so far we have zero problems reported)...however if you are in any doubt stay on v1.1.10 for now**


### To install on Non-Jailbroken device:

* Download the ipa on your Mac/PC from: [DropBox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5h8djnt0z3vd77v/Fly_v1.2.1_test_unsig.ipa?dl=0)
* Then sign and install manually.

### To install on Jailbroken device:


* Download the ipa on your Mac/PC from: [DropBox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5h8djnt0z3vd77v/Fly_v1.2.1_test_unsig.ipa?dl=0)
* Then sign and install manually.


### When the app is installed

**You will need internet access on the device for the initial activation.**
**You shoudn't need to do this step if you have just upgraded from v1.2.x which was already authenticated**

* On the iDevice go to iOS Settings app -> Mod DJI Fly
* Enter your login details in the login field.
* Open the Mod DJI Fly app (if you've already opened the app after installation, force close it, then re-open it)
* Agree to the normal prompts exactly how you would on the stock app.
* **The only very important prompt is to allow location services**

Once you get to the DJI Fly home screen, go back to the iOS settings and verify that in the status field it now says 'Activated'.

That's it, you're good to go... there will be no prompts when you launch the app, as long as your status says 'Activated' you will be in FCC mode. Of course this can still be verified in the transmission tab of the app.

It goes without saying don't share/post your login information anywhere, there is absolutely no reason to do so.
If you have more than one device registered with us (some people have multiple devices or registered devices for friends) you will have 2/3/4 different logins, make sure you only use one login on each device, and please inform any other users (friends etc) of their login information.

**Sharing logins will result in your account being banned**

Any issues/questions then just let me know/ask
