# Unsigned Installation

**Remember this ipa is not signed, if your iDevice is not jailbroken YOU have to sign the app before you can install it.**

### To install on a non-jailbroken device

* Download the ipa on your Mac/PC from: [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqeau82xmsz7mme/Mod_DJI_Fly_v1.4.0_unsig.ipa?dl=1)
* <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqeau82xmsz7mme/Mod_DJI_Fly_v1.4.0_unsig.ipa?dl=1"> <i class="fab fa-dropbox" style="font-size: 66px;"></i></a>

* Then sign and install manually.
* [Information on signing can be found here]({% link signing.md %})

### To install on a jailbroken device

**Make sure you have installed the package 'appsync unified' via Cydia from the official repo (https://cydia.akemi.ai)**

**[Tap here to add the repo to Cydia](cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://cydia.akemi.ai/)**

* Tap on the icon below to begin installation, agree to the installation prompt, then return to your homescreen and observe the installation progress.
* Note: Installation can take a couple of minutes as the app is quite large, so be patient. The app icon will turn from black to light grey when installation is complete.

# When the app is installed

**You will need internet access on the device for the initial activation.**

* On the iDevice go to iOS Settings app -> Mod DJI Fly
* Enter your login details in the login field.
* Open the Mod DJI Fly app (if you've already opened the app after installation, force close it, then re-open it)
* Agree to the normal prompts exactly how you would on the stock app.
* **The only very important prompt is to allow location services**

Once you get to the DJI Fly home screen, go back to the iOS settings and verify that in the status field it now says 'FCC Mode Activated'.

That's it, you're good to go...as long as the status in iOS settings says 'FCC Mode Activated' you will be in FCC mode. You will receive a notification when using the app which indicates your status also. Of course this can still be verified in the transmission tab of the app.

It goes without saying don't share/post your login information anywhere, there is absolutely no reason to do so.
If you have more than one device registered with us (some people have multiple devices or registered devices for friends) you will have 2/3/4 different logins, make sure you only use one login on each device, and please inform any other users (friends etc) of their login information.

**Sharing logins will result in your account being banned**

# Upgrading

**If upgrading from v1.2.x you do not need to uninstall the Mod DJI Fly app first, just follow the installation instructions above, you wont have to login/authenticate again if you do it this way...you only need to uninstall if you were using an old version or a Mod app from another provider**
