# Unsigned Installation

**Remember this ipa is not signed, if your iDevice is not jailbroken YOU have to sign the app before you can install it.**

**The unsigned ipa for v1.2.0 is still being tested, so dont get angry if there are issues...stay on v1.1.10**

**Uninstall any existing Mod DJI Fly app before proceeding**

## To install on a non-jailbroken device

**Make sure you have installed the package 'appsync unified' from Cydia**

* Download the ipa on your Mac/PC from: [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhxrukny2srelpm/Mod_DJI_Fly_v1.2.0_gdsig.ipa?dl=0)
* Then sign and install manually.

## To install on a jailbroken device

* On the iDevice go to: [Appbox link](https://tiny.app.link/hr7bqFDTjbb)
* Tap on 'Install application', then tap 'install' when the alert pops up...return 	to your home screen to see installation progress.

**or**

* On the iDevice download the ipa (select direct download) from here: [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8p5rtf227objiqa/Mod_DJI_Fly_v1.2.0_dsig.ipa?dl=0)
* Install manually or via Filza


## When the app is installed

**You will need internet access on the device for the initial activation.**

When the app is installed
* On the iDevice go to iOS Settings app -> Mod DJI Fly
* Enter your login details in the login field.
* Open the Mod DJI Fly app (if you've already opened the app after installation, force close it, then re-open it)
* Agree to the normal prompts exactly how you would on the stock app.
* **The only very important prompt is to allow location services**

Once you get to the DJI Fly home screen, go back to the iOS settings and verify that in the status field it now says 'Activated'.

That's it, you're good to go... there will be no prompts when you launch the app, as long as your status says 'Activated' you will be in FCC mode. Of course this can still be verified in the transmission tab of the app.

It goes without saying don't share/post your login information anywhere, there is absolutely no reason to do so.
If you have more than one device registered with us (some people have multiple devices or registered devices for friends) you will have 2/3/4 different logins, make sure you only use one login on each device, and please inform any other users (friends etc) of their login information.

**Sharing logins will result in your account being banned**

Any issues/questions then just let me know/ask


## Upgrading
