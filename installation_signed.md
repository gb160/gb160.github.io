# Signed Installation
Please follow the steps **exactly**

* Uninstall the current Mod DJI Fly app if you have it installed.
* On the iDevice go to: [Appbox link](https://tiny.app.link/S5PU8HOInbb)
* Tap on 'Install application', then tap 'install' when the alert pops up...return 	to your home screen to see installation progress.(It seems on iOS 14.x sometimes you just get a greyed out app icon while the app is downloading/installing, so dont panic, just wait for the app to appear on your homescreen. )

## When the app is installed

**You will need internet access on the device for the initial activation.**

* On the iDevice go to iOS Settings app -> Mod DJI Fly
* Enter your login details in the login field.
* Open the Mod DJI Fly app (if you've already opened the app after installation, force close it, then re-open it)
* Agree to the normal prompts exactly how you would on the stock app.
* **The only very important prompt is to allow location services**

Once you get to the DJI Fly home screen, go back to the iOS settings and verify that in the status field it now says 'Activated'.

That's it, you're good to go... there will be no alerts when you launch the app, as long as the status in iOS settings says 'Activated' you will be in FCC mode. Of course this can still be verified in the transmission tab of the app.

It goes without saying don't share/post your login information anywhere, there is absolutely no reason to do so.
If you have more than one device registered with us (some people have multiple devices or registered devices for friends) you will have 2/3/4 different logins, make sure you only use one login on each device, and please inform any other users (friends etc) of their login information.

**Sharing logins will result in your account being banned**

Any issues/questions then just let me know/ask
