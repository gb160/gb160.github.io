**It seems on iOS 14.x sometimes you just get a greyed out app icon while the app is downloading/installing, sometimes it looks like it's doing nothing at all...dont panic, just wait for the app to appear on your homescreen, if you're upgrading you'll know it's finished when you get a light blue dot next to the Mod DJI Fly label, BE PATIENT as it can take a minute or 2... this is an issue with AppBox and isn't something I can fix**

## When the app is installed

**You will need internet access on the device for the initial activation.**

* On the iDevice go to iOS Settings app -> Mod DJI Fly
* Enter your login details in the login field.
* Open the Mod DJI Fly app (if you've already opened the app after installation, force close it, then re-open it)
* Agree to the normal prompts exactly how you would on the stock app.
* **The only very important prompt is to allow location services**

Once you get to the DJI Fly home screen, go back to the iOS settings and verify that in the status field it now says 'FCC Mode Activated'.

That's it, you're good to go...as long as the status in iOS settings says 'FCC Mode Activated' you will be in FCC mode. You will receive a notification when using the app which indicates your status also. Of course this can still be verified in the transmission tab of the app.

It goes without saying don't share/post your login information anywhere, there is absolutely no reason to do so.
If you have more than one device registered with us (some people have multiple devices or registered devices for friends) you will have 2/3/4 different logins, make sure you only use one login on each device, and please inform any other users (friends etc) of their login information.

**Sharing logins will result in your account being banned**
