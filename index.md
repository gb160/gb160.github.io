# Information


Please read the following before doing anything:

This app is iOS only, current version v1.1.10

**YOU MUST ARRANGE APP SIGNING YOURSELF**

**PLEASE ASK ABOUT THIS BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER IF YOU'RE NOT SURE.**

**By purchasing the app it is presumed that you know how to sign the app and install on your device.**


If you have a jailbroken iDevice you wont need to sign the app.

We can guarantee that the current app version will achieve FCC mode with the current firmware, we don't know what the future holds so update the firmware at your own risk.

Due to limited test devices, we can only guarantee the app will work on iOS12 and iOS13...we hold no responsibility if you're running an older or newer OS and the app doesn't work.
(We have had positive feedback from a lot of users on iOS 14 but haven't yet tested it fully)

If none of this is a problem then Paypal Â£10 UK/GBR (RECIPIENT RECEIVES, AS FRIENDS AND FAMILY) to:

[PayPal link](https://paypal.me/fccdjifly/10GBP)

or

gb160@protonmail.com

Do not select 'Paying for goods or services'

Please put your email address in the PayPal reference so I know who you are, and send me a quick email confirming your payment has been made, PayPal notifications 
are very often late/non existent.

You will be issued a login that will activate the app on 1 device for 12 months.
You will be entitled to free updates within that 12 months.


# Upgrading

If you already have the Mod DJI Fly app installed, and you wish to update to a newer version, then just follow the same installation instructions that you were sent originally, but ignore the step about uninstalling your current app.

Unless you are told otherwise you will be uble to update direct to the latest version without uninstalling.
