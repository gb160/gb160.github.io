# Mod DJI Fly


Please read it all before doing anything:

This app is iOS only, current version v1.1.10

**YOU MUST ARRANGE APP SIGNING YOURSELF...PLEASE ASK ABOUT THIS BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER IF YOU'RE NOT SURE. 
By purchasing the app it is presumed that you know how to sign the app and install on your device.**


If you have a jailbroken iDevice you wont need to sign the app.

We can guarantee that the current app version will achieve FCC mode with the current firmware, we don't know what the future holds so update the firmware at your own risk.

Due to limited test devices, we can only guarantee the app will work on iOS12 and iOS13...we hold no responsibility if you're running an older or newer OS and the app doesn't work.
(We have had positive feedback from a lot of users on iOS 14 but haven't yet tested it fully)

If none of this is a problem then Paypal £10 UK/GBR (RECIPIENT RECEIVES, AS FRIENDS AND FAMILY) to:

[PayPal link](https://paypal.me/fccdjifly?locale.x=en_GB)

or

gb160@protonmail.com

Do not select 'Paying for goods or services'

Please put this email address in the PayPal reference so I know who you are

You will be issued a login that will activate the app on 1 device for 12 months.
You will be entitled to free updates within that 12 months.

Cheers
